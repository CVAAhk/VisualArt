Omeka Everywhere&mdash;developed by [Open Exhibits](http://openexhibits.org)&mdash;is a tool which allows an institution to connect an Omeka Classic instance to a multitouch table or device. The Omeka Everywhere Collection Viewer uses the Omeka API to pull a chosen repository into an interactive experience without having to re-create any metadata. To learn more about Omeka and how to set up a repository, visit [omeka.org](http://omeka.org/). The Omeka Everywhere collaboration between [Ideum](http://ideum.com), the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University, and the University of Connecticut is made possible by an IMLS grant.

Please visit the Open Exhibits forum for support for the Omeka Everywhere Collection Viewer. For support on Omeka repositories, visit the [forum](http://omeka.org/forums/) at omeka.org.
